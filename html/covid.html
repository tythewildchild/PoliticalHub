                <li>COVID is not causing us to die more.

                    shows that in 2018 there were 2,839,205 deaths. For 2020 CDC has a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid_weekly/index.htm#AgeAndSex">table chart</a> 
                    <br>showing 2,203,637 deaths to date (10/14/2020). This doesn't include deaths in Jan, but if <br>
                    we add those in, there is a total of 2,441,841 deaths this year. 400,000 more deaths are needed <br>
                    by the end of the year if we are to match the death rate of 2018. Death rates are going down significantly<br>
                    since mid year. I'd calculate total deaths in 2020 to be from 2.8 million to 2.95 million.<br>
